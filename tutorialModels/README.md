Sample models for the glTF tutorial

These sample models are used in the glTF tutorial. They are targeting glTF version 1.1.
The `.gltf` files of these models are edited *manually*, to make the names and order 
of the properties match the descriptions in the tutorial.

See the `README.md` in each model's directory for details.

| Model                                                  | Screenshot                                                      | Description|
|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| [Triangle Without Indices](TriangleWithoutIndices)     | ![](TriangleWithoutIndices/screenshot/screenshot.png)           | The simplest possible glTF asset: A single scene with a single node and a single mesh with a single mesh primitive with a single triangle with a single attribute, without indices and without a material |
| [Triangle](Triangle)                                   | ![](Triangle/screenshot/screenshot.png)                         | A very simple glTF asset: A single scene with a single node and a single mesh with a single mesh primitive with a single indexed triangle with a single attribute, without a material |
| [Animated Triangle](AnimatedTriangle)                  | ![](AnimatedTriangle/screenshot/screenshot.gif)                 | One of the most simple possible glTF assets including an animation: A single scene with a single node with a single animated property and a single mesh with a single mesh primitive with a single indexed triangle with a single attribute, without a material |
| [Simple Material](SimpleMaterial)                      | ![](SimpleMaterial/screenshot/screenshot.png)                   | One of the most simple possible glTF assets including a material: A single scene with a single node and a single mesh with a single mesh primitive with a single indexed triangle with a single attribute, with a material that only consists of an emissive color |
| [Simple Meshes](SimpleMeshes)                          | ![](SimpleMeshes/screenshot/screenshot.png)                     | A simple scene with two nodes, both containing the same mesh, namely a mesh with a single mesh primitive with a single indexed triangle with multiple attributes, without a material |
| [Advanced Material](AdvancedMaterial)                  | ![](AdvancedMaterial/screenshot/screenshot.png)                 | A simple scene with two nodes, both containing the same mesh, namely a mesh with a single mesh primitive with a single indexed triangle with multiple attributes, with a material that includes a light and thus shows the effect of the normals attribute |
| [Simple Opacity](SimpleOpacity)                        | ![](SimpleOpacity/screenshot/screenshot.png)                    | A simple scene with multiple nodes, meshes and materials, where the materials have different opacity values, ranging from fully transparent to fully opaque |
| [Simple Texture](SimpleTexture)                        | ![](SimpleTexture/screenshot/screenshot.png)                    | A single scene with a single node and a single mesh with a single mesh primitive, with a material that contains a single texture |
| [Cameras](Cameras)                                     | ![](Cameras/screenshot/screenshot.png)                          | A single scene with a single node and a single mesh with a single mesh primitive, without a material, but with two different cameras |
| [Simple Skin](SimpleSkin)                              | ![](SimpleSkin/screenshot/screenshot.gif)                       | A simple scene with very basic vertex skinning |
